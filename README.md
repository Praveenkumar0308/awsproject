Case Study: Employee Profile Management System on AWS
1. Overview
XYZ Company required a secure and scalable system where new employees could input their information and upload photos, while existing employees could access their profiles. The solution was built using AWS services to ensure high availability, automation, and cost efficiency.

2. Architecture & Implementation Steps
âœ… VPC & Networking Setup:

Configured a VPC with three subnets (1 Public, 2 Private).

Public subnet: Hosted Application Load Balancer (ALB) for external access.

Private subnets: Deployed EC2 instances for the application and an RDS database for secure data storage.

âœ… Compute & Scaling:

Deployed EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group, ensuring high availability.

Configured an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic efficiently.

âœ… Database & Storage:

Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL): Stored structured employee details securely.

Amazon DynamoDB: Used for fast, scalable storage of employee metadata.

Amazon S3: Hosted employee profile photos and enabled serverless event-driven processing.

âœ… Domain Mapping & Security:

Registered a domain name and mapped it with the Load Balancer.

Configured IAM instance profiles to grant EC2 instances access to RDS, DynamoDB, and S3.

âœ… Automation & Event Handling:

AWS Lambda: Triggered when an employee uploads a photo to S3, performing processing (e.g., resizing).

SNS Topic: Sends notifications to subscribed users when a new employee profile is created.

3. Benefits & Outcomes
âœ” Scalability & High Availability: Load Balancer & Auto Scaling ensure the system can handle increased traffic.
âœ” Improved Security: Private subnets for database, IAM instance profiles for controlled access.
âœ” Automation & Real-time Processing: Lambda + SNS reduce manual intervention.
âœ” Cost Efficiency: Optimized resource usage via Auto Scaling & on-demand services.

4. Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Integrate AWS Step Functions for automating employee verification workflows.
ðŸ”¹ Implement Amazon OpenSearch for fast profile searches.
ðŸ”¹ Use Amazon Rekognition for face verification on uploaded images.
